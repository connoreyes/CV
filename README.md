# Computer Vision Fundamentals – Sobel Edge Detection

This project implements **Sobel edge detection from scratch** to build a deep understanding of core computer vision concepts.

## What this covers
- Images as pixel intensity matrices
- Grayscale conversion
- Manual convolution (no black-box OpenCV filters)
- Sobel X and Sobel Y kernels
- Edge magnitude computation

## Why this matters
Instead of relying on prebuilt functions, this project demonstrates how edge detection works at a low level, which is foundational for:
- Computer vision pipelines
- CNN feature extraction
- Object detection and perception systems

## Files
- `lect2.py` – Sobel edge detection implemented from first principles
- `learningnumpy.py` – Supporting NumPy practice
- `liveedge.py` - Sobel edge detection from a live feed
- `captureedge.py` - Sobel edge detection from a captured frame

## Next steps
- Canny edge detection
- Noise reduction and edge thinning
- Transition to CNN-based feature maps
